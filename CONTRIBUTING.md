## Guidelines

### Quality Standards

All contributions should:

- Be related to Claude Skills
- Provide clear value to users
- Include accurate, up-to-date information
- Use proper formatting and grammar

### Formatting

When adding a new item:

```markdown
- **[Name](link)** - Clear, concise description of what it does
```

Examples:

```markdown
- **[pdf-analyzer](https://github.com/username/pdf-analyzer)** - Advanced PDF analysis skill with OCR support
- **[Claude Skills Tutorial](https://example.com/tutorial)** - Step-by-step guide to creating your first skill
```

#### Adding an individual skill

Add a row to the individual skills table using the same pattern as the other rows.

### Skill Submissions

When submitting a skill, please include:

- Clear name and link to the skill repository
- Brief description (1-2 sentences) of what it does
- Any prerequisites or dependencies
- License information (if applicable)

The skill should:

- Have a clear purpose and use case
- Include documentation (README or SKILL.md)
- Follow Claude Skills best practices
- Be functional and tested

Above all else, the skill should be a value-add. Trivial functionalities that were whipped up with a session or two with Claude Code are not likely to be worthwhile skills for community members to make use of almost by definition (i.e. if the skill could be created that quickly, it would probably be something an individual would implement by themselves to match their own particular use case)

While not an absolute requirement, a strong general guideline would be that more exists to the skill than a single `SKILL.md` file. 

### Article/Resource Submissions

When submitting articles or resources:

- Ensure the content is substantial and informative
- Include the title and a direct link
- Add a brief description
- Verify all links work correctly

## Categories

Place your contribution in the most appropriate category:

- **Official Resources** - Only official Anthropic content
- **Documentation** - Technical documentation and reference material
- **Official Skills** - Skills from anthropics/skills repository
- **Community Skills** - Skills created by the community
- **Tools & Utilities** - Development tools and utilities
- **Tutorials & Guides** - How-to guides and tutorials
- **Articles & Blog Posts** - Published articles and blog posts

If you're unsure which category fits best, place it where you think it belongs and mention it in your PR description.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Search existing PRs** - Check if someone else has already submitted something similar
2. **One item per PR** - Submit one skill/resource per pull request (unless they're closely related)
3. **Clear title** - Use a descriptive PR title like "Add PDF analysis skill" or "Add tutorial on creating custom skills"
4. **Description** - Explain what you're adding and why it's valuable
5. **Test links** - Ensure all links work before submitting
6. **Follow the format** - Match the existing style and structure

### PR Title Examples
